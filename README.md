# Logan's Neighborhood map!
* This is a map of the Bay View neighborhood in Milwaukee, WI.
* It includes the first 5 restaurants on my list to visit since moving here.
* Clicking on each marker will bring up a small description of what the restaurant serves and a picture provided by the Foursquare API.
* There's a search function to find the perfect restaurant for you by name. Clicking on a result will point it out on the map and will open the description.

## Instructions
* Download the GitHub [repository](https://github.com/loganbrick/neighborhood-map).
* Extract the zip!
* Open the index.html file with any of your favorite widely-supported browsers.
* Note that the app does require an Internet connection!
